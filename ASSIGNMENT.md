At Acast we love podcasts and this assignment serves two purposes. One is obviously for both
of us to assess whether you and Acast are a good fit for this position but the other one is for you
to scratch the surface of what’s being a software engineer at Acast is like and tackle a problem
within the podcast ecosystem. You can timebox it to 4 hours since we don’t expect you to spend
more time than that and here are also some pointers to help you understand what we are
looking at when evaluating the assignment.
● We will look at the code to see how well it is structured, how easy it is to read and how
simple it would be to maintain.
● We expect that you'll be able to motivate and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the
choices in your solution.
● We understand that there isn't a lot of time for implementation, and we keep that in mind.
We expect that the code will have both strong and weak areas, and we'll be looking to
bring those up when we meet to discuss your solution.
● Please list what you left out. For example things that you would have spent more time on
if you had more time, and what things you did not spend time on at all.

# Assignment
Create a tiny API that uses some web framework in Node.js to expose an http endpoint that
takes an rss url, parses it and returns a list of episodes from that rss feed. Should be REST
(-ish). Any parse errors that are returned by the parsing module should propagate in a nice way
to the client. Also, for each episode, fetch and include in the result a checksum of the MP3 file
for the episode. The resulting json should look something like this:
[
{ title: 'Episode 1 - abc', checksum: 123, url: 'xyz' },
{ title: 'Episode 2 - abc', checksum: 234, url: 'qwe' }
]
Also cover parts of the project with unit test/s. Think about how you structure your files and
folders, maintain good naming conventions, pick libraries for common tasks etc. Write the code
as if this project would extend to more functionality and be maintainable by a team. Also jot
down the trade offs you made, stuff you left out (if any) etc.
You can browse https://play.acast.com for shows and pick a rss url from there. Or you can use
e.g. https://rss.acast.com/varvet.
If you feel you have the time, you can also do this subtask: Extend the API with an extra
endpoint that takes an episode url (to an mp3) and returns the id3 tag info (as a json).
Please deliver your result in a zip file.
